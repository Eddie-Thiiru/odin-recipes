    <h2>Chocolate Fudge Brownies</h2>
        <p>What is the best kind of brownies, fudge brownies vs chewy brownies? Well, 
            it&rsquo;s a matter of taste, some people will lean toward chewy brownies 
            while others, fudge brownies. Some chewy brownies are like eating cake and 
            i would rather have a chocolate cake than a &ldquo;cake brownie&rdquo;. I fall 
            into the fudge brownie territory but not too fudgy; i like my brownies to 
            have more texture and a little bit of chew. The trick to making a well balanced 
            fudge brownie that&rsquo;s fudgy while also having texture and a subtle chew is 
            to use both cocoa powder and melted chocolate. This is an easy recipe that will 
            give you some of the best brownies you will ever eat.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups (227 grams) dark chocolate(60% to 70% cacao)</li>
            <li>1 cup (228 grams) unsalted butter, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 cup (128 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (213 grams) tightly packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup(198 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate chips (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F/177°C. 
                Grease a 9 x 13-inch cake pan with cooking spray or butter and line with parchment 
                paper and grease the parchment paper too.</li>
            <li>Place the dark chocolate, butter, and cocoa powder in a heatproof bowl set over a 
                saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water. Cook over medium heat to melt 
                the butter, using a spatula to stir the mixture until the butter and chocolate have 
                melted and combined. Set the bowl aside and let the mixture cool while preparing the 
                other ingredients. </li>
            <li>Whisk together the floor and salt in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine the eggs, sugars and vanilla in a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer, 
                whisk on low until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium 
                and slowly pour in the chocolate mixture. continue whisking on medium until the batter is 
                smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the batter and use a spatula to mix until just combined.
                 Add about ¾ of the chocolate Chips and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the top. Sprinkle the 
                remaining chocolate Chips over the batter. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a skewer
                 inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few crumbs attached, be careful 
                 not to overbake. Cool completely before slicing.</li>
            <li>Run a butter knife along the edges of the pan and lift the brownies out of the pan and onto 
                a cutting board. Slice into rectangles, according to your preferred size, and serve. The brownies 
                can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated upto 1 week.</li>
