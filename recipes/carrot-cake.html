        <h2>Frosting  Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>450g full-fat block cream cheese at room temperature</li>
                <li>½ cup (115g) unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
                <li>4 cups (480g) confectioners sugar</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the cake.</strong> Start by preheating the oven to 149°C. Line a baking sheet with 
                    parchment paper, spread the chopped pecans on the sheet and toast for 7-8 minutes. Remove from 
                    the oven and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn the oven up to 177°C. Grease two or three 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then 
                    grease the parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Whisk the brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla together in a large bowl 
                    until combined.</li>
                <li>In another large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, 
                    and cloves together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a spatula, fold 
                    the ingredients together until just combined. Fold in the carrots and 1 cup of the toasted pecans.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans. If using three cake pans, bake for 20-24 minutes. If using 
                    two cake pans, bake for 30-35 minutes. Test the center with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, 
                    the cakes are done. If not, continue to bake until cooked through but be careful not to over-bake. 
                    Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a rack</li>
                <li><strong>Make the frosting.</strong> In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the 
                    cream cheese and butter together on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners sugar, 
                    vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat 
                    for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners sugar if frosting is too thin, 
                    a little milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should 
                    be soft, but not runny.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the cake.</strong> Using a serrated knife or cake leveler, layer off the tops of the cakes 
                    to create a flat surface. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand. Evenly cover the top with frosting. 
                    Top with 2nd layer, more frosting, and then top with the 3rd layer. Spread the remaining frosting all over 
                    the top and sides. Decorate the sides and top of the cake with the remaining toasted pecans. Refrigerate cake 
                    for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>The leftover cake can be stored in a tight container and refrigerated for up to 5 days.</li>
